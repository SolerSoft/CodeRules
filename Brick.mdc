# Brick API

- When generating Brick code always use @file ./Context7.mdc to validate the syntax with the 'getdutchie/brick' library.

# Code Generation
- Whenever a Model class is added or changed, we must run 'dart run build_runner build' from within the Brick project. This generates Adapters and Client Migrations.
