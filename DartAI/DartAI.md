Always interact with Dart AI via MCP to understand learn about outstanding tasks and to verify the completion of a task and subtasks.

Always update task status from 'To-do' to 'Doing' when starting a task, and from 'Doing' to 'Done' when a task is complete.

Update the description of a task when starting it to append new details about the execution plan.

Update the description again when a task is complete to append any differences between the execution plan and actual implementation.

Don't create new tasks or subtasks without asking for confirmation to do so.
